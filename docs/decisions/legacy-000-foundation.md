- **Workspace Admin foundation:** `/app/#/admin` is discoverable only when
  `/api/me.can_admin` is true (signed-in person and current-workspace owner).
  The additive `can_admin_instance` uses the operational predicate below. New GET-only users/connections/runtime/limits/stuck
  inventories bind the decoded path ID to the authenticated workspace before any
  projection source read. Members and owner connections receive the exact
  person-owner refusal; foreign workspace IDs are concealed with 404. Personal
  data remains workspace-local; no global directory or mutation action is added.
  Operational deploy and backup GETs require a signed-in person + current-workspace
  owner + exact server-fetched `users.is_admin=1`, read per request through the
  bounded RO connection, including `/api/me`. Authenticated ordinary failures use
  exactly “Instance administrator access required”; missing users deny and read
  faults on instance data routes fail closed with 503 before source reads.
  A capability-read fault in `/api/me` preserves the 200 bootstrap response with
  `can_admin_instance:false`; data routes always recheck authority. Signed-out keeps
  the existing gateway 401 challenge. No authority extends to other workspaces’ personal data.
  The installed route inventory mirrors both authenticated Admin GET prefixes.

- **Admin read and lifecycle bounds:** New projections use an existing SQLite
  `mode=ro` connection, connection-local `query_only`, at most 250 ms busy/connect
  wait and a 2 second monotonic request budget with progress interruption. They
  acquire no application locks, initialize no stores and invoke no memory worker.
  They capture UTC once through `gateway.admin_clock.utc_now`; the paired
  `monotonic` seam controls deadlines. Credential expiry authentication retains
  its existing clock. Explicit field allowlists omit credentials, raw policy and
  login links; display redaction does not modify stored content. Lists page in batches of 100 with full filtered counts, using creation time/ID,
  project slug/ID or card number as appropriate. Each UI load,
  including initial identity/body decoding, settles within its 5,000 ms client
  deadline independently of other sections and the shared refresh fan-in. Abort,
  page epochs and request generations clear private state on disposal or expiry.
  Only the exact Admin route bypasses shared refresh; card navigation restores a
  regular base view and loads the requested card without new inventory requests.
  Inventory counts share the row membership/user joins; Retry preserves the failed
  cursor and append or replacement mode. Sign-out and expiry stop an existing Admin
  controller; it is null until mounted.
